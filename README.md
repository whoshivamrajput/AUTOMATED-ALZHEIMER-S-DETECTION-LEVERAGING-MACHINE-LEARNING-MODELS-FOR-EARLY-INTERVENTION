# AUTOMATED-ALZHEIMER-S-DETECTION-LEVERAGING-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS-FOR-EARLY-INTERVENTION
The progressive neurodegenerative disease known as Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a major effect on cognitive abilities. In order to manage and halt the progression of disease, early and correct detection is essential. Through the use of multiple forms of medical data, including genetic, clinical, and imaging (MRI, PET) data, machine learning (ML) approaches have become potential tools for the early identification of Alzheimer's disease. An overview of the most popular machine learning algorithms used in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is provided in this work. These algorithms include ensemble techniques, Random Forests, Deep Learning, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The study highlights the advantages of these approaches in terms of improving prediction accuracy, detecting subtle patterns in high-dimensional data, and integrating multimodal data sources. The review also discusses the challenges, including data heterogeneity, interpretability of models, and the need for high volume, explanatory datasets. Future directions include the development of more interpretable models and the integration of ML techniques with real-time monitoring technologies for personalized treatment approaches. 
We analyzed that the models before didnâ€™t focus majorly on the classification of the Alzheimer, this model focuses on the classification of the Alzheimer and we have applied four model that classifies the extent of seriousness of the disease. 
Resnet, with the highest accuracy of 74% accuracy and 73% precision, performs best according to the table. However, the confusion matrix shows that other models like VGG also perform quite well, especially in terms of detecting more true positives.
