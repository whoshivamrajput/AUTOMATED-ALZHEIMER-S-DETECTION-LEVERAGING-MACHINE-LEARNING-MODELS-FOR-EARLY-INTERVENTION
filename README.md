Alzheimer's disease impacts cognition, requiring early detection. ML techniques like ResNet, VGG, and SVM use genetic, clinical, and imaging data for diagnosis. ResNet showed top accuracy (74%) and precision (73%), while VGG excelled in true positives. Future focus: interpretable models &amp; real-time monitoring.
